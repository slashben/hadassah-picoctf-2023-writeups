About the riddle:
The riddle's name is findme. The goal is to find the flag and submit it. How it works? You get a link to the opening screen, do a little research on it(why nothing happens when we enter the given username and password?), and by that you can find new hints by yourself(like base64 addresses) in addition to the "regular hint you receive. The riddle looks like that:

Challenge description:
There are given user name and password: the user name is test and the password is test!
When I automatically entered the password and the username I reached to this page called "Welcome fellow Human": 
But any kind of searching didn't help me at all and I got stacked in the same page. So I tried to do things differently and this is how it goes: 
I press f12 to enter developer tools because i wanted to understand what's going on "behind-the-scenes" when we try to search something, so than 
I pressed on “network tab” and then I clicked “preserve logs” so it will log the logs when you log in. 
And then I entered the same way again(with the given username test and password test!) and suddenly I saw new 2 given id’s:
 
After I looked at the id’s it looked to me like base64 so I initially put the second part as it had "==" which made it look
like base64(I used the website https://www.base64decode.org/). I got this back ...y_25bbae9a}
which looks like the end of a flag. And when i putted both of the id's that I found together I got
the flag once you decode the base64. 
 

And then I submitted the flag:picoCTF{proxies_all_the_way_a0fe074f}
 

	And then I received 100 points.
Hint:
“Any redirections?”

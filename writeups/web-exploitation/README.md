## Hints
1. “Any redirections?”

## Initial look
when i tried to submit the givven username and password nothing happend.
# How to solve it

I have looked at the hints. 

The hint gave me the impression, that I have been redirected after i entered the username and the password. 
Any kind of searching in the website didn't help me at all and I got stacked in the same page. So I tried to do things differently and this is how it goes: 
Because I wanted to understand how things are "behind the scene" meaning what happens after we enter username and password 
I press f12 to enter developer tools, than I pressed on “network tab” and then
I clicked “preserve logs” so it 
Will log the logs when you log in. And then I entered 
the same way again(with the given username test and password test!) and suddenly I saw new 2 given id’s

After I looked at the id’s it looked to me like base64 so I copied the first id and after that the second id and
After I added "==" it looked like a feet address in base64(I used the website https://www.base64decode.org/).

when I tried to decode at first every 
id separately it didn't look like something I can work with so I decoded them together. 
and only after I decoded them together I got the fit flag and submitted it.
 

So I submitted the flag:    picoCTF{proxies_all_the_way_a0fe074f}

And then I received 100 points.




Voila!!! 😎

The flag is `picoCTF{proxies_all_the_way_a0fe074f}`

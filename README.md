# For students

1. Choose the challenge you want to solve [here](https://play.picoctf.org/practice?category=1&page=1), **note it needs to be at least for 100 points and it needs to be a challenge others are not working on**
2. Open a pull request on this file by adding yourself to the section "Who is doing what?" above, not the create the related directories and readme and point to with the link. (just I did 😉), **see **the notes **below**!!!****
3. When I approve the pull request you can start to work on the challenge
4. Your task is done when you completed your write-up, sent me and I accepted your pull request.

## Notes about the first and second pull request
1. In the first pull request, add your name and challenge to this file as I did under "Who is doing what?" section - this enables others to see which challenge is already taken
2. In the second pull request, open a directory under [writeups/web-exploitation](/writeups/web-exploitation) with the name of your challenge
3. In the second pull request put a README.md into the above directory where you explain your solution (see my example [here](/writeups/20aHEAD)), if you used code like python, add it to the same directory
4. Don't use docx format, go according to the example
